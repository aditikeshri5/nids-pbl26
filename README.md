Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

Website: https://aditikeshri5.github.io/nids-pbl26/

This project proposes a Hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System that combines Machine Learning and Cryptography to identify suspicious network behavior. Using the NSL-KDD dataset and live browser activity simulation, the system analyzes traffic patterns instead of encrypted payloads. Cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity before classification, making the approach secure and practical for modern networks.
